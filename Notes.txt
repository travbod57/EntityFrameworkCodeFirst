Foreign Key needs name of navigation property "SchoolNav" and the name of the referenced entities' Primary Key "Id". FOreign key in DB named "SchoolNavId". 
For more normal DB foreign key name use navigation property "School" and referenced entities' Primary Key "Id"

    public class School
    {
        public School()
        {
            Teacher = new List<Teacher>();
        }

        public int Id { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Teacher> Teacher { get; set; }
    }

	public class Teacher
    {
        public Teacher()
        {
            Pupils = new List<Pupil>();
        }

        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }

        public int SchoolNavId { get; set; } -- name of DB FK ultimately given here but guided by the SchoolNav and Id combo
        public School SchoolNav { get; set; }

        public ICollection<Pupil> Pupils { get; set; }
    }

Alternatively for complete control, ForeignKey attribute is used to marked the entity navigation property. You can then name the DB FK what you like "SchoolNavProp"

	public class School
    {
        public School()
        {
            Teacher = new List<Teacher>();
        }

        public int Id { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Teacher> Teacher { get; set; }
    }

	public class Teacher
    {
        public Teacher()
        {
            Pupils = new List<Pupil>();
        }

        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey("School")]
        public int SchoolNavProp { get; set; } -- can name this what you like because the FroeignKey attribute is marking the navigation property for you
        public School School { get; set; }

        public ICollection<Pupil> Pupils { get; set; }
    }

virtual keyword enables lazy loading on the property
